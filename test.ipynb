Alan Greenspan indicated on Monday that the U.S. economy would not sustain its recent growth, where the Dow Industrials set day-to-day records and the White House signaled on Tuesday that it would revise its estimate of fourth-quarter 2006 GDP growth down to an annual rate of about 2.3 percent from an initial forecast of 3.5 percent and was increasingly nervous that the figure could come in even lower.\n",
